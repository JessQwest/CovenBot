#**Online Covens & Groups**
---

This is a list of online covens, groves, circles, and groups that have been submitted to r/CovenFinder. These groups conduct their workings on the Internet. 

There are 2 lists here; **casual** and **formal**. All formal covens have an application process in order to gain access to the coven. In general they are more structured and focussed. 

Casual covens can be structured or freestyle and anything in between. While there might be age/location restrictions, none of these have an application process.

Please note that even Discord servers without age restrictions are still limited to those 13+ as of their Terms of Service. Please do not use Discord under the age of 13, and check other site's ToS too.
